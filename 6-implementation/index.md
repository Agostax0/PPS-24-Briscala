# Implementation
The task-oriented development methodology ensured that the work was divided fairly among the team members. 
After an initial group phase, during which the project's foundations were laid and some architectural and design details were defined, tasks were assigned based on priority, regardless of the module they belonged to. 
Furthermore, each task encompassed entire features of the application (from implementation in the DSL to display in the view, including testing), so every team member worked on all sections of the project. 
Below are the individual contributions of each member.
