# Sprint Goal
This first sprint's goal is to define the project's main structure, defining the core elements, their expected use, functions and interactions.
# Sprint Deadline
This sprint's deadline is set for 22/06/2025.
# Sprint Review
An initial diagram was drawn for a more as-a-whole understanding of the project to be.

A consensus was met for how code, documentation and resources should be written. 

# Sprint Retrospective
This was a bumpy start, due to overlapping work this sprint's throughput has not been consistent, although it is expected since this first phase requires every member's participation.
