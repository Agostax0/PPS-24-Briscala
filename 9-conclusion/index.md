# Conclusion
The team is satisfied with the results achieved in this project. 
We successfully implemented all the set functional requirements, and we also had time to add some additional features, such as the ability to play with bots.

In general, the development experience was great, with the team rarely encountering difficulties, thanks especially to the smart division of tasks and the thorough requirements analysis phase.

## Future improvements
Aside from the implementation of new features, there are several improvements that could be applied to the existing code.

`EngineController` would need a refactoring to make the class more state-oriented, so that it becomes easier to extend and test

There are some other examples of uses of "old" / Java-like code patterns that could be made more functional.
